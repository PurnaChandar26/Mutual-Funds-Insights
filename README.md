Mutual Fund Insights 
==================== 

Project Overview:
----------------

This project aims to provide valuable insights for investors in the mutual fund industry through a comprehensive analysis of mutual fund data using both data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It represents a fusion of meticulous data cleaning and transformation, interactive data visualization using Tableau, and insightful EDA findings.The EDA findings enhanced my understanding of the variables and their inter-relationships. Utilizing these insights, I strategically integrated sorting and filtering functions into the Tableau dashboard, elevating its interactivity and productivity, ensuring a more effective dashboard.

#### Features

-   Category and Subcategory Selection: Analyze mutual funds by category (e.g., Hybrid, Equity, Debt) and subcategories (e.g., Thematic Mutual Funds, Sectoral Funds) for refined analysis.
-   Sorting and Filtering: Explore mutual funds by sorting and filtering based on various parameters like scheme_name, expense_ratio, fund_age_yr, and more.
-   Visual Insights: Gain a deep understanding of mutual fund performance metrics, historical trends, and meaningful comparisons through interactive charts and graphs.
-   Risk Assessment: Assess the risk associated with mutual funds using metrics like sortino, alpha, sd, beta, sharpe, and risk_level.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was used to gain a deeper understanding of the data and identify relationships between different variables. Statistical tests and data visualizations were performed to explore the data and identify key insights for investors. The EDA findings were used to design the Tableau dashboard and strategically integrate sorting and filtering functions, enhancing its interactivity and productivity.

#### Key EDA Analyses

1.  Top 10 Fund Managers by 5-Year Returns: Identified the top 10 fund managers based on the average 5-year returns of their managed funds.
2.  Top 5 Fund Managers in Each Category by Average 5-Year Returns: Listed the top 5 fund managers in each category (Equity, Debt, Hybrid) based on the average 5-year returns of their funds.
3.  Top 10 Fund Managers by Number of Schemes: Determined the top 10 fund managers with the highest number of mutual fund schemes under their management.
4.  Top 10 Fund Managers by Oldest Schemes: Identified the top 10 fund managers whose schemes had been active for the longest duration.
5.  Top 10 Fund Managers with the Highest Assets Under Management (AUM): Ranked the top 10 fund managers based on the total assets under management across their schemes.
6.  SIP and Lump Sum Investment Requirements by Category: Analyzed and compared the minimum SIP and lump sum investment requirements across different fund categories.
7.  Expense Ratio Variation Across Different Fund Size Groups and Categories: Examined how the expense ratio varied across different fund size groups and categories.
8.  Fund Size Distribution: Explored the distribution of fund sizes within the dataset.
9.  Analysis on Fund Age: Analyzed the distribution of fund ages to understand the landscape of mutual funds in the dataset.
10. Analysis on Risk Level: Examined the distribution of mutual funds based on their risk levels.

## Methodology:

### Data Preparation and Cleaning

I began by acquiring a dataset containing mutual fund information, including parameters such as scheme_name, min_sip, min_lumpsum, expense_ratio, fund_size_cr, and more. To ensure data accuracy, I meticulously cleaned and formatted the dataset, removing errors and inconsistencies. This step was crucial to produce reliable insights.

### ETL Process

I performed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations to transform the data into a usable format. This involved structuring the data and ensuring it was ready for analysis. I also enriched the dataset with relevant information, including fund categories and subcategories, enabling better categorization and analysis.

### Data Visualization

Once the data was clean and transformed, it was visualized using Tableau. A variety of charts and graphs were used to explore the data and identify trends and patterns. The visualizations were designed to be interactive and easy to understand, even for users with no prior experience with Tableau.

## Conclusion:

This project has demonstrated my ability to use data analysis and visualization skills to transform raw data into actionable information. The Tableau dashboard that I created provides valuable insights for investors in the mutual fund industry.
