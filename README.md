Mutual Fund Insights

This project aims to provide valuable insights for investors in the mutual fund industry through a comprehensive analysis of mutual fund data using both data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It represents a fusion of meticulous data cleaning and transformation, interactive data visualization using Tableau, and insightful EDA findings. This project is a testament to my data analysis and visualization skills, showcasing how I transformed raw data into actionable information using Tableau.

Data Preparation and Cleaning

I began by acquiring a dataset containing mutual fund information, including parameters such as scheme_name, min_sip, min_lumpsum, expense_ratio, fund_size_cr, and more. To ensure data accuracy, I meticulously cleaned and formatted the dataset, removing errors and inconsistencies. This step was crucial to produce reliable insights.

ETL Process

I performed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations to transform the data into a usable format. This involved structuring the data and ensuring it was ready for analysis. I also enriched the dataset with relevant information, including fund categories and subcategories, enabling better categorization and analysis.

Interactive Tableau Dashboard

Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard that allows users to sort and filter mutual funds based on various parameters such as scheme_name, expense_ratio, fund_age_yr, and more. Users can also explore mutual funds by category, including Hybrid, Equity, Debt, Solution Oriented, and Other. Additionally, subcategories like Thematic Mutual Funds, Sectoral Funds, Large & Mid Cap Funds, Aggressive Hybrid Mutual Funds, and many more are available for refined analysis.

The dashboard features interactive visualizations, including charts and graphs, to help users gain a deep understanding of mutual fund performance metrics, historical trends, and meaningful comparisons. Users can also assess the risk associated with mutual funds through metrics such as sortino, alpha, sd, beta, sharpe, and risk_level.

The user-friendly design of the dashboard ensures easy navigation and exploration of mutual fund data for investors of all experience levels.

Findings from Data Exploration

The EDA findings enhanced my understanding of the variables and their inter-relationships. Utilizing these insights, I strategically integrated sorting and filtering functions into the Tableau dashboard, elevating its interactivity and productivity, ensuring a more effective dashboard.

In this EDA, I conducted the following analyses:

-   Top 10 Fund Managers by 5-Year Returns
-   Top 5 Fund Managers in Each Category by Average 5-Year Returns
-   Top 10 Fund Managers by Number of Schemes
-   Top 10 Fund Managers by Oldest Schemes
-   Top 10 Fund Managers with the Highest Assets Under Management (AUM)
-   SIP and Lump Sum Investment Requirements by Category
-   Expense Ratio Variation Across Different Fund Size Groups and Categories
-   Fund Size Distribution
-   Analysis on Fund Age
-   Analysis on Risk Level
-   Analysis on Asset Management Companies (AMCs)
-   Analysis of Fund Ratings
-   Analysis on Fund Categories and Sub-Categories
-   Analysis of Alpha
-   Analysis of Standard Deviation (SD)
-   Analysis of Beta
-   Analysis on Sharpe Ratio
-   Analysis on Sortino Ratio
