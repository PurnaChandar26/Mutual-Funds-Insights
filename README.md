Mutual Fund Insights 
==================== 

Project Overview:
----------------

This project aims to provide valuable insights for investors in the mutual fund industry through a comprehensive analysis of mutual fund data using both data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It represents a fusion of meticulous data cleaning and transformation, interactive data visualization using Tableau, and insightful EDA findings.The EDA findings enhanced my understanding of the variables and their inter-relationships. Utilizing these insights, I strategically integrated sorting and filtering functions into the Tableau dashboard, elevating its interactivity and productivity, ensuring a more effective dashboard.

#### Features

-   Category and Subcategory Selection: Analyze mutual funds by category (e.g., Hybrid, Equity, Debt) and subcategories (e.g., Thematic Mutual Funds, Sectoral Funds) for refined analysis.
-   Sorting and Filtering: Explore mutual funds by sorting and filtering based on various parameters like scheme_name, expense_ratio, fund_age_yr, and more.
-   Visual Insights: Gain a deep understanding of mutual fund performance metrics, historical trends, and meaningful comparisons through interactive charts and graphs.
-   Risk Assessment: Assess the risk associated with mutual funds using metrics like sortino, alpha, sd, beta, sharpe, and risk_level.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was used to gain a deeper understanding of the data and identify relationships between different variables. Statistical tests and data visualizations were performed to explore the data and identify key insights for investors. The EDA findings were used to design the Tableau dashboard and strategically integrate sorting and filtering functions, enhancing its interactivity and productivity.

#### Key EDA Analyses

1.  Top 10 Fund Managers by 5-Year Returns: Identified the top 10 fund managers based on the average 5-year returns of their managed funds.
2.  Top 5 Fund Managers in Each Category by Average 5-Year Returns: Listed the top 5 fund managers in each category (Equity, Debt, Hybrid) based on the average 5-year returns of their funds.
3.  Top 10 Fund Managers by Number of Schemes: Determined the top 10 fund managers with the highest number of mutual fund schemes under their management.
4.  Top 10 Fund Managers by Oldest Schemes: Identified the top 10 fund managers whose schemes had been active for the longest duration.
5.  Top 10 Fund Managers with the Highest Assets Under Management (AUM): Ranked the top 10 fund managers based on the total assets under management across their schemes.
6.  SIP and Lump Sum Investment Requirements by Category: Analyzed and compared the minimum SIP and lump sum investment requirements across different fund categories.
7.  Expense Ratio Variation Across Different Fund Size Groups and Categories: Examined how the expense ratio varied across different fund size groups and categories.
8.  Fund Size Distribution: Explored the distribution of fund sizes within the dataset.
9.  Analysis on Fund Age: Analyzed the distribution of fund ages to understand the landscape of mutual funds in the dataset.
10. Analysis on Risk Level: Examined the distribution of mutual funds based on their risk levels.

## Methodology:

### Data Preparation and Cleaning

I began by acquiring a dataset containing mutual fund information, including parameters such as scheme_name, min_sip, min_lumpsum, expense_ratio, fund_size_cr, and more. To ensure data accuracy, I meticulously cleaned and formatted the dataset, removing errors and inconsistencies. This step was crucial to produce reliable insights.

### ETL Process

I performed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations to transform the data into a usable format. This involved structuring the data and ensuring it was ready for analysis. I also enriched the dataset with relevant information, including fund categories and subcategories, enabling better categorization and analysis.

### Data Visualization

Once the data was clean and transformed, it was visualized using Tableau. A variety of charts and graphs were used to explore the data and identify trends and patterns. The visualizations were designed to be interactive and easy to understand, even for users with no prior experience with Tableau.



## How to Use the Dashboard Effectively

To effectively utilize the Tableau dashboard for mutual fund analysis, follow these steps:
<br>

### 1. Select the Number of Funds (Top):

- Use the slider or input field to specify the number of mutual funds you want to compare. You can choose a range from 5 to 100 mutual funds for analysis. This selection helps you narrow down the list of funds for detailed comparison.
<br>

### 2. Choose the Fund Category:

- Select the broad category of mutual funds you want to analyze. Categories include Equity, Debt, Hybrid, Solution Oriented, and others. This choice will filter the funds within your selected category.
<br>

### 3. Specify the Subcategory:

- Further refine your analysis by choosing a subcategory within the broader fund category. For example, you can select subcategories like ELSS Mutual Funds, Equity Savings Mutual Funds, Fixed Maturity Plans, and more. This will help you focus on a specific type of fund.
<br>

### 4. View the Mutual Fund Analysis Table:

- Once you've specified the number of top funds, the category, and, if applicable, the subcategory, the dashboard will generate a comprehensive mutual fund analysis table. This table will display individual mutual funds as rows and various parameters as columns, including Fund Size (in crores), Rating, Minimum SIP (Systematic Investment Plan), Minimum Lumpsum, 1-Year, 3-Year, and 5-Year Returns, Alpha, Beta, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Standard Deviation (SD), Expense Ratio, and Fund Age.

- You can sort each column in ascending or descending order to compare and analyze the funds based on your preferred criteria. For example, you can sort by 5-Year Returns to identify funds with the best long-term performance, or sort by Expense Ratio to find funds with lower expenses.

<br>

### 5. Explore the 3-Year Fund Returns Table:

- This table shows all the mutual funds in your selected subcategory and provides their 3-year return percentages.

- The background is a heat map that helps you quickly identify trends and variations in returns.

<br>

### 6. Compare ROI for Selected Funds:

- The dashboard also offers a bar graph that compares the Return on Investment (ROI) for the selected number of top funds in your chosen subcategory.

- The graph displays 1-Year, 3-Year, and 5-Year returns for an easy visual comparison of fund performance.
<br>
By following these steps, you can make data-driven investment decisions and gain valuable insights into the mutual fund industry.

## Disclaimer:

It's important to note that mutual fund investments are subject to market risks, and their values may fluctuate. This project is intended for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice or a recommendation to invest in any specific mutual fund.

## Conclusion:

This project has demonstrated my ability to use data analysis and visualization skills to transform raw data into actionable information. The Tableau dashboard that I created provides valuable insights for investors in the mutual fund industry.
